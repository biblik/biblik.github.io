Since 2016, I am a lecturer at [École des Mines de Nantes](http://www.mines-nantes.fr), a french engineer school. I teach courses concerning optimization and computer sciences.

In June 2016, I received my Ph.D in Computer Science, specialized in Operations Research from École des Mines de Nantes, France. My Ph.D was supervised by Nathalie Bostel and Fabien Lehuédé.

My work focuses on vehicle routing problems, specially with synchronization constraints. I am part of the Logistics and Production Systems ([SLP](http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/fr/presentation-equipe-slp)) team from [IRCCyN](http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr) laboratory.
