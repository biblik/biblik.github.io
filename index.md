I am currently working as a lecturer in the french engineering school [École des Mines de Nantes](http://www.mines-nantes.fr). My position consists in teaching courses about optimization and computer sciences and also investigating on Vehicle Routing Problems, specially with synchronization constraints. I am part of the Logistics and Production Systems ([SLP](http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/fr/presentation-equipe-slp)) team from [IRCCyN](http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr) laboratory.

In June 2016, I received my Ph.D in Computer Science, specialized in Operations Research from École des Mines de Nantes, France. My Ph.D was supervised by Nathalie Bostel and Fabien Lehuédé.
